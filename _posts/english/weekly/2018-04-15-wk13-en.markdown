<h3>Forward</h3>

Dear Brothers and Sisters:

We continue the reading on the `Book of Numbers`. Israelites presented offerings before the Tabernacle
and marched toward the land of Canaan. No one in that generation except Caleb and Joshua were
allowed to go into the land due to their lack of faith. But still, God reaffirmed His promise.

May our Lord renew all brothers and sisters with His word.
