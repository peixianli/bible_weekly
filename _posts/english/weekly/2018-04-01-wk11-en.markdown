# Weekly Guide: Week 11   [(中文)](/guide/wk11.html)

## Day 1, Skin Care

### Question: What were the regulation on taking care of the Israelites’ skin?

### Scripture Reading: Leviticus 13-14

### Meditation: God’s Story
* Continued with regulation to keep Israelites holy in order to worship God.

* Skin diseases such as the horrible leprosy are easily transmitted. The priests took great care when examining skin diseases. Anyone contracted skin diseases needed to go through a long and elaborative cleansing and offering process.

* Israelites not only had to keep their skins clean, their clothes and houses also needed the same attention.

### Meditation: My Story
* Identity – Transmittable skin diseases such as leprosy often being assimilated to man’s sin. Cleansing and the offering are assimilated to reconciling with God. Putting blood on ear lobe, hand, toe, and thumb are similar to consecration of the priests. Jesus has already redeemed us through His blood and completely satisfied all necessary cleansing and offering. His sacrifice was perfect. Let me pray and thank Him for everything He has done for me.

* Integrity – The source of skin diseases is not limited to skin but the cloth we wear and the house we live in, too. Same can be said about sin. It may come from anything around us. How does the cleansing process in these two chapters remind me?

### Scripture Reading: Psalm 71

### Prayer

## Day 2, Day of Atonement

### Question: What are the other regulations to keep Israelites holy?

### Scripture Reading: Leviticus 15-16

### Meditation: God’s Story
* More regulations to keep Israelites holy so they can worship God.

* Chapter 15 is about bodily discharges. It was aimed to keep the Israelites “separate from things that make them unclean.” This is so that “they will not die in their uncleanness for defiling my dwelling place.”

* Chapter 16 is the regulation for the Day of Atonement. During this day, all Israelites need to keep sabbath, deny themselves, cleanse, and atone for all their sins.

### Meditation: My Story
* Identity – All offerings and cleansing were to help the Israelites to become a nation of holiness. It was to separate them from the unclean. The holy God promised to walk with me and asks me to be holy. What does this remind me?

* Integrity – God established the annual Day of Atonement. Israelites could restart from a new beginning with their sins forgiven. But this did not mean that they could take their sins lightly. My sins were forgiven because of Jesus Christ. How do I view my own sins?

### Scripture Reading: Psalm 72

### Prayer

## Day 3, Holy Behaviors

### Question: What behaviors did God want to forbid?

### Scripture Reading: Leviticus 17-18

### Meditation: God’s Story
* God told the Israelites that to be holy, they need to behave holy.

* Chapter 17 was about blood. Blood is holy. In the covenant God made with Noah, animal’s meats were edible “but you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it” (Genesis 9:4) “for the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar.” (Leviticus 17:11)

* Chapter 18 is about adultery. Marriage is holy. “Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.” (Hebrews 13:4) God warned Israelites do not defile themselves by conforming to the unclean culture of the Canaanite in the land they were to enter.

### Meditation: My Story
* Identity – “For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar.” The blood of animal can only cleanse a man’s sins temporary. Only Jesus Christ’s blood can cleanse forever. We have to atone our sins in front of God in order to receive the cleansing blood. How should I live to show my respect to Jesus’ precious blood?

* Community – God established marriage and everyone need to respect it and keep it holy. God warned Israelites not to conform to the Canaanites. Marriage is currently being attacked from all fronts in the world we live in. How do I keep myself holy within my marriage and not conform to the society?

### Scripture Reading: Psalm 73

### Prayer

## Day 4, Various Laws

### Question: What other behaviors not pleasing to God?

### Scripture Reading: Leviticus 19-20

### Meditation: God’s Story
* Chapter 19 details the morality, law, worship, and spiritual life and covers all the Ten Commandments. A total of 16 short sections with each ending with the phrase "I am the Lord." "Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy." is the basis for calling upon the people to live holy lives. "Love your neighbor as yourself" appears in the verses and tells Israelites that the standard of holiness is not just keeping the law, but also to actively live out its virtue.

* Chapter 20 is an addendum to chapters 18 and 19. It’s the punishment for those who rebel and unholy. Those who committed offenses must face severe punishments, executed, or cut off.

### Meditation: My Story
* Community – Sin is not something private. It spreads and brings down the whole community like yeast in the dough. We not only are responsible for cleansing ourselves of sins but fellow Christians, too. How do these two chapters remind me of my views toward sin?
* Integrity – "Be holy because I, the Lord your God, am holy." This was the basis for God to elect Israelites and a basis for my life. Is there any part of my life I need to pay more attention in order to be holy?

### Scripture Reading: Psalm 74

### Prayer

## Day 5, Holy Priests

### Question: What are other requirements for priests?

### Scripture Reading: Leviticus 21-22

### Meditation: God’s Story
* The priests are set apart from the people for God. The requirements for the priests are even higher. God set clear priority to their duty and daily lives.

* Holy objects are set apart for God. Israelites needed to keep these objects holy.

* The phrases “I am the Lord who makes them holy” or similar appeared 6 times and “I am the Lord” appeared 6 times, as well.

### Meditation: My Story
* Identity – God set high standards for the priests. How does today’s passage reminds me that I am a chosen royal priest?
* Fidelity – What’s my priority compare tasks at hand and serving God? What do the requirements God set for the priests remind me?

### Scripture Reading: Psalm 75

## Day 6, The Festivals

### Question: What festivals do the holy people need to observe?

### Scripture Reading: Leviticus 23:1-24:9

### Meditation: God’s Story
* Chapter 23 lists all the festivals the Israelites need to observe. Including Sabbath, Passover, Festival of Unleavened Bread, Offering the Firstfruits, Festival of Weeks, Festival of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Festival of Tabernacles.

* 24:1-9 lists the regulations for the lamps and breads in the Tabernacle.

### Meditation: My Story
* Walking with God – What are the commonalities of the 7 festivals in chapter 23? What do they remind me? There are still many Christian holidays nowadays, but many have lost their original intent. What should I do in these holidays for the remembrance of my savior?
