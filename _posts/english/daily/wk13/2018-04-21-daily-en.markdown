### Question
How Levites purified and made themselves ceremonially clean before they serve?

### Bible Reading
[{{ verse1 }}][bgLink1] | [[YouVersion]][yvLink1] 

### Meditation: God's Story 

+ In 8:1-4, God commanded Moses to tell Aaron to light up the 7 golden lamps the first time. God
wanted the area in front of the lampstands to be filled with light.

+ Verses 8:5-26 records God’s regulations for purifying the Levites. They were sent to the priests
to be purified and made offerings. They were to work in the tent of meeting. The Levites were
chosen as substitute for all firstborns to serve God and make atonements for the Israelites.
Levites were positioned between the Veil and the Israelites, so they don’t have to get close to
the Holy of the Holies.
 
+ Verses 9:1-14 records the first Passover after the Israelites came out of Egypt.

### Meditation: My Story 

+ **Walking with God** – In this passage we see God provided a way to celebrate Passover for those
who wish to celebrate but unable to follow the regulations because they were unable to keep
themselves ceremonially clean. However, those who were able to follow the regulations but
chose not to celebrate would be cut off. It is the heart that God values. Do I desire God in my
heart?
 
+ **Identity** – High Priest Aaron lit up the lamps to make light shine in the Holy Place. Jesus Christ is
the light of the world, lit up the path for us to walk on. What does it mean to walk in His light in
my daily life?

+ **Fidelity** – The Levites must first clean, then atone, and then present their offerings before they
can serve. What does this ordering remind me of?
